The [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) is a web development stack that prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and full-stack typesafety. It is built around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), and includes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Additional modules, such as [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [Prisma](https://prisma.io/), and [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), can be added based on the needs of the project.

To streamline the setup of a T3 Stack app, the seasoned T3 Stack developers have built a CLI called `create-t3-app`. This CLI generates a modular template based on the specific needs of the user.

However, it is important to note that create-t3-app is not an all-inclusive template, and users are expected to bring their own libraries that solve the needs of their application. While the T3 Stack developers have opinions and insights on various aspects of web development, they do not want to prescribe solutions to specific problems like state management and deployment. They do, however, have some recommendations listed on their website.

The T3 Stack developers follow a set of core beliefs, which they call the T3 Axioms. They believe in solving problems with specific, necessary solutions, using bleeding edge technology responsibly, and prioritizing typesafety.

The T3 Stack was created because Theo refused to create a template of his favorite technologies. The developers were inspired by create-next-app, Astro's CLI, and a general love for typesafety, and worked hard to build the best possible starting point for new T3 Stack projects.

One of the core technologies used in the T3 Stack is TypeScript. While JavaScript can be difficult to work with, the T3 Stack developers believe that TypeScript provides a better experience for web developers. It provides live feedback as you write your code, helping to catch errors early and increase productivity.

Another important technology in the T3 Stack is Next.js. The developers love React, but they find that it can lead developers down some difficult paths. Next.js offers a lightly opinionated, heavily optimized approach to creating applications using React.

The T3 Stack also includes tRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. tRPC provides a GraphQL-like experience without the boilerplate, while Prisma generates types from a user-defined schema, guaranteeing end-to-end typesafety from the database to the app. Tailwind CSS provides good default building blocks for styling, making it easy to create a good-looking app.

Overall, the T3 Stack is a great choice for those interested in using Next.js in a typesafe, modular way. It provides a streamlined development experience while allowing developers to bring in their own libraries to solve specific problems.
